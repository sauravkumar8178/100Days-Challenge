# 100-Day Full Stack Development Challenge

Welcome to my 100-Day Full Stack Development Challenge repository! In this challenge, I aim to complete full-stack development from scratch within 100 days and then create an enterprise-level project.

## About the Challenge

This challenge is a personal journey to enhance my skills in full-stack development. Over the course of 100 days, I will be coding, learning, and building projects from scratch. Each day, I will document my progress, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

## Goals

- Complete full-stack development curriculum within 100 days.
- Build a strong foundation in frontend and backend technologies.
- Gain practical experience by working on real-world projects.
- Develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
- Create an enterprise-level project showcasing my skills and knowledge.

## Technologies/Frameworks

During this challenge, I will be working with a variety of technologies and frameworks, including but not limited to:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- Other Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, npm/yarn

## Repository Structure

- `day-001-to-day-100/`: This folder contains subfolders for each day of the challenge, documenting my progress, code, and reflections.
- `enterprise-project/`: Once the challenge is completed, this folder will contain all the code, documentation, and resources related to my enterprise-level project.

## Progress Tracking

I will be using GitHub Issues and Projects to track my progress, set goals, and manage tasks. Each day's progress will be documented in the corresponding issue or project card.

## How to Contribute
